This is my INST126 Final Project

What my program does: 

This project is creating a weather analysis using Python and use advanced strings to extract weather information, such as temperature, dates, and weather conditions. Find a weather API and extract weather data from it, and then use matplotlib, numpy, and pandas to analyze and visualize the data.

Firstly, I chose OpenWeatherMap weather API to obtain weather data. I registered and obtained an API key on their website. The next step is to use the OpenWeatherMap API to obtain data and use matplotlib, numpy, and pandas for data analysis and visualization.

How to use my program 
1.	Find and open the Terminal in the application

2.	Make sure ensure that necessary libraries are installed before running the code
My project requires the installation of matplotlib, pandas, and numpy modules.
 Put “pip install requests matplotlib numpy pandas” in the Terminal to import the three modules. 

3.	My code is in a folder called “Final_project” on the desktop, and then I can perform the following steps: input “cd Desktop/Final_project” in the Terminal.

4.	To obtain the OpenWeatherMap API key. Register and obtain API keys on the OpenWeatherMap website.

5.	Replace API key and city name
YOU_ OPENWATERMAP_ API_ Replace KEY with the API key you obtained in OpenWeatherMap.
YOU_ CITY_ Replace the name with the city name where you want to obtain weather data. I want to get the weather for Baltimore, so I switched to Baltimore.

6.	Save and run the code to run the following command:
Python Final_ Project.py
If everything is normal, you should see a graphical window displaying a chart of weather analysis.
